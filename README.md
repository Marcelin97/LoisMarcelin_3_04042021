##Project nÂ°3 : **Dynamisez une page web avec des animations CSS**

Name of the project : _Ohmyfood_

The goal was to integrate a mockup provided by a designer, using HTML and CSS (and using SASS) from scratch.

## I had to develop a 100% mobile site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants.

[Download the Node.js : Version 14.16.1](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.16.1/node-v14.16.1-x64.msi)

\*npm run serve --> For development mode. Once you run it, allows you to code in sass and see it in real time in your browser.
(We run the command once and as soon as we change something in the scss the css code is recompiled)

\*npm run start --> For production mode. Compile your sass into a minified css.
